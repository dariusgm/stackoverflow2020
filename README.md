# Installation Native

Install pyenv on your platform, see: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv


```
pyenv install 3.9.2
pyenv local 3.9.2
pyenv rehash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv install --dev --python 3.9.2
pipenv run notebook
```

# Installation Docker

Please note: Depending on your setup, sudo or root may (not) be required for running the docker commands. 

```
sudo docker build -t dariusblog .
```
This may take some time.


# Starting Native

When you used the native installation, you can run the notebook by running:
```
pipenv run jupyter-notebook
```

# Starting Docker

And in case you used the docker approach, please use this command:
```
sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 dariusblog
```

Please wait a minute to allow the notebook to boot up. Than you can access under http://localhost:8888 the notebook. Do not run this Dockerfile on a public server, as no credentials are required to access the jupyter server.
